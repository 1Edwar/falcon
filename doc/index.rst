Falcon: The Unladen WSGI Framework
==================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Falcon is a minimalist WSGI library for building fast web APIs and app backends.

When it comes to building HTTP APIs, other frameworks weigh you down with tons of dependencies and unnecessary abstractions. Falcon cuts to the chase with a clean design that embraces HTTP. We like to think of Falcon as the Dieter Rams of web frameworks; functional, simple, and elegant.

.. code:: python

    class CatalogItem(object):

        # ...

        @falcon.before(hooks.to_oid)
        def on_get(self, id):
            return self._collection.find_one(id)

    app = falcon.API(after=[hooks.serialize])
    app.add_route('/items/{id}', CatalogItem())


Testimonials
------------

**S. Magr√≠**
    I feel like I'm just talking HTTP at last... with nothing in the
    middle... Falcon seems like the 'requests' of backend.

**K. Conway**
    Needed to roll a REST API in a hurry for a project. Falcon proved
    fast and effective.

**jlegler**
    The source code for falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to
    documentation. It basically can't be wrong.
